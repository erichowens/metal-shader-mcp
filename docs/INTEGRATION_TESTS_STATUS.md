# Integration Tests Implementation Status

## Summary
We've made significant progress on Epic 2 Phase 1 integration testing, but have encountered architectural limitations that need to be addressed before completing the integration test suite.

## What We've Accomplished

### 1. Mock MCP Server ✅
Created a comprehensive Node.js mock MCP server (`Tests/Integration/mock-mcp-server.js`) with multiple test scenarios:
- **success**: Normal operation with proper JSON-RPC responses
- **timeout**: Server that doesn't respond (for testing timeout handling)
- **malformed**: Returns invalid JSON (for error handling tests)
- **crash**: Server that crashes after first request
- **slow**: Slow but valid responses (1-2 second delays)
- **intermittent**: Randomly succeeds or fails
- **large**: Returns large payloads (>10KB)
- **ping-only**: Only responds to ping requests
- **partial**: Returns incomplete JSON responses
- **error**: Returns proper JSON-RPC error responses

The mock server:
- Writes properly formatted JSON-RPC responses to stdout
- Logs non-interfering debug messages to stderr
- Handles various edge cases and failure modes
- Is executable and ready to use

### 2. Integration Test Framework ✅
Created comprehensive integration test file (`Tests/Integration/MCPIntegrationTests.swift`) with:
- 19 test methods covering all scenarios from Epic 2 plan
- Proper async/await test setup and teardown
- Helper methods for waiting on connection states
- Tests for:
  - Basic connectivity and communication
  - Health checks
  - Timeout handling
  - Malformed response handling
  - Server crash detection and recovery
  - Performance (slow responses, large payloads)
  - Reliability (intermittent failures)
  - Connection state transitions

### 3. Package Configuration ✅
- Added IntegrationTests target to Package.swift
- Configured proper dependencies on MetalShaderStudio
- Included mock server as test resource

## Architectural Issues Blocking Completion

### The Core Problem
The `MCPLiveClient` class was designed for internal use and has several characteristics that make it difficult to test:

1. **Private API**: The `sendRequest()` method is `private`, so tests can't directly send requests
2. **No Lifecycle Control**: No public `start()`/`stop()` methods - the client auto-launches via internal `ensureLaunched()`
3. **Combine Publisher**: `connectionState` is a `CurrentValueSubject<ConnectionState, Never>`, not a simple property, so state comparisons require `.value` access
4. **MCPBridge Protocol**: The client only exposes shader-specific methods through the MCPBridge protocol (setShader, exportFrame, etc.), not generic request methods

### What This Means
To properly test the MCPLiveClient against our mock MCP server, we need to either:

**Option A: Refactor for Testability** (Recommended)
- Make `sendRequest()` `internal` instead of `private` (visible to tests in same module)
- Add optional test-mode constructor that allows custom server commands with arguments
- Consider extracting health check logic to a separate component
- Add proper lifecycle methods for testing (`startForTesting()`, `stopForTesting()`)

**Option B: Test Through Public API Only**
- Only test via the MCPBridge methods (setShader, exportFrame, etc.)
- Modify mock server to respond to shader-specific requests
- This limits our ability to test generic MCP functionality
- Still need visibility into connection state and health checks

**Option C: Create Test Double**
- Create a separate `TestableMCPClient` that implements MCPBridge
- Use dependency injection to swap implementations
- More invasive refactoring required

## Recommended Next Steps

### Immediate Actions (High Priority)
1. **Add Internal Visibility for Testing**
   ```swift
   // In MCPLiveClient.swift
   init(serverCommand: String, serverArgs: [String] = []) {
       // Allow passing args for testing
   }
   
   internal func sendGenericRequest(method: String, params: [String: Any]?) throws -> Any? {
       // Wrapper around private sendRequest for testing
   }
   
   internal func forceTerminate() {
       // Allow tests to clean up
       terminateChild()
   }
   ```

2. **Simplify Integration Tests**
   - Start with testing only the health check functionality
   - Use the existing MCPBridge methods as entry points
   - Verify connection state transitions without direct request sending

3. **Update Epic 2 Plan**
   - Document testability improvements needed
   - Consider adding Epic 2.5 for "Test Infrastructure Improvements"

### Medium-Term Improvements
1. **Structured Logging** (Already in Epic 2)
   - Implement proper logging framework
   - Make logs observable in tests

2. **Metrics/Telemetry** (Already in Epic 2)
   - Add observable metrics for test validation
   - Track request/response counts, latencies, error rates

3. **Dependency Injection**
   - Consider IoC pattern for better testability
   - Make it easier to swap components in tests

## Current Status
- ✅ Mock MCP server complete and tested
- ✅ Integration test structure complete
- ❌ Integration tests do not compile due to API visibility
- ⏸️ Blocked on architectural refactoring decisions

## Files Modified
- `/Tests/Integration/mock-mcp-server.js` - Created
- `/Tests/Integration/MCPIntegrationTests.swift` - Created (needs refactoring)
- `/Package.swift` - Updated with IntegrationTests target

## Next Developer Actions Required
1. Review recommended refactoring options (A, B, or C above)
2. Make architectural decision on testability approach
3. Implement chosen approach
4. Update integration tests to match new API
5. Run and debug integration tests
6. Continue with remaining Epic 2 tasks (stress tests, UI integration, etc.)

## Notes
- All existing unit tests still pass
- MCPLiveClient health check functionality is implemented and working
- Connection state management is functional
- The only blocker is test accessibility to internal APIs
