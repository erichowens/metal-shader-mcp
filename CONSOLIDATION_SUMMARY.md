## Consolidation Strategy

### Phase 1: Extract to Consolidation Branch âœ…
1. Cherry-pick key commits from PR #29 (headless-mcp)
2. Cherry-pick key commits from PR #27 (ci/coverage)
3. Cherry-pick key commits from PR #25 (policy/mcp-first-enforcement)
4. Resolve any conflicts carefully
5. Test that everything builds and tests pass

### Phase 2: Merge Consolidation to Main
1. Create PR from consolidation branch
2. Get CI passing
3. Merge to main

### Phase 3: Rebase & Merge PR #49
1. Rebase PR #49 onto updated main
2. Resolve conflicts (should be minimal)
3. Ensure all tests pass
4. Merge PR #49 to complete Epic 1

### Phase 4: Cleanup
1. Close PRs #29, #27, #25 with reference to consolidation
2. Delete all feature branches
3. Celebrate clean main branch! ðŸŽ‰
