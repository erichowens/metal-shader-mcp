## üìã PR #49: Epic 1 Complete - Ready for Merge

**Branch**: `feature/mcp-live-client`  
**Status**: Conflicts resolved, updated, tests running  
**CI Status**: Some failures need investigation (Swift tests, ui-smoke, single-flight)

### Novel & Important Features
1. **MCPLiveClient**: Full stdio JSON-RPC transport with Process communication
2. **MCPBridge Protocol**: Clean abstraction (FileBackedBridge + LiveBridge)
3. **Event-Driven Architecture**: Replaces polling with async/await
4. **Structured Error Handling**: MCPError types with UI banner
5. **Auto-Detection**: MCP_SERVER_CMD env var with fallback
6. **Comprehensive Tests**: Mock-based MCPBridgeTests
7. **Visual Evidence**: 300+ animation frames for regression
8. **Documentation**: Complete CHANGELOG and ROADMAP updates

## üì¶ Features Preserved from Closed PRs

### From PR #29 (feature/headless-mcp)
- Task Master ‚Üî GitHub Issue Sync workflow
- ShaderRenderCLI headless Metal renderer
- ML Aesthetic Metrics (contrast/saturation/edges/LAB harmony)
- ROADMAP.md and PRIORITIES.md living documents
- CI hardening (Metal toolchain detection, macOS-15 pinning)
- Security fixes (removed shell exec vulnerabilities)
- Agent handoff protocol

### From PR #27 (ci/coverage)
- Toolchain Pinning (macOS-14, Xcode 16.0, Ubuntu 22.04)
- Concurrency Groups (cancel superseded runs)
- CI Contract Enforcement workflow
- Nightly Schedules + manual dispatch
- Swift Code Coverage (llvm-cov reports)
- Shader Metadata parsing from docstrings
- Save As flow + metadata MCP endpoints

### From PR #25 (policy/mcp-first-enforcement)
- Node/Jest Workflow for MCP server (MCP_FAKE_RENDER=1)
- Visual Regression Tests (baseline/diff via MCP tools)
- Policy Tests (enforcing MCP-first architecture)
- Deterministic CI-safe rendering
- MCP Tool unit tests (set_shader/run_frame/export_sequence)
- README badges for test workflows
- ESM Jest configuration

## üöß Next Steps

### Immediate (To Complete Consolidation)
1. **Investigate & Fix CI Failures in PR #49**
   - Swift Tests and Quality Checks: FAILURE
   - ui-smoke: FAILURE  
   - single-flight: FAILURE
   - Other checks still running

2. **Once CI Passes, Merge PR #49**
   ```bash
   gh pr merge 49 --squash --admin --delete-branch
   ```

3. **Update Local Main**
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git pull origin main
   ```

### Follow-up (After PR #49 Merges)
1. **Extract Features from Closed PRs**
   - Create new branches for each set of features
   - Cherry-pick or re-implement key commits
   - Open smaller, focused PRs for each feature set

2. **Specific Feature PRs to Create**
   - `feature/task-issue-sync` - Task Master ‚Üî GitHub sync
   - `feature/shader-render-cli` - Headless Metal renderer + ML metrics
   - `feature/ci-hardening` - Toolchain pins, concurrency, coverage
   - `feature/node-jest-tests` - MCP server testing framework
   - `feature/metadata-ui` - Shader metadata parsing + Save As

3. **Clean Up Branches**
   ```bash
   git branch -d feature/strict-mcp-client
   git branch -d feature/mcp-ui-client
   # (remote branches auto-deleted on PR close)
   ```

## üéâ Success Metrics

- **Before**: 6 open PRs with overlapping/conflicting changes
- **After PR #49 Merges**: 0 open PRs, clean main branch with Epic 1 complete
- **Next**: Smaller, focused PRs for remaining features

## üìö Reference Documents

- `CONSOLIDATION_SUMMARY.md` - Detailed analysis of all PRs
- `AGENT_HANDOFF.md` - Updated with local-first testing rule
- `CHANGELOG.md` - Epic 1 completion documented
- `ROADMAP.md` - Epic 1 marked complete

**Note**: This consolidation focused on getting PR #49 (the most complete and important work) ready to merge first. Additional features from closed PRs are documented and will be integrated via smaller, focused PRs afterward.
